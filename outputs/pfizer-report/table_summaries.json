Key observations include:\n\n* **Operating Activities:** Cash provided by operating activities decreased from $32,922 million in 2021 to $29,267 million in 2022. This was primarily due to increased payments to BioNTech for Comirnaty and increased inventories for Paxlovid, partially offset by higher net income and timing differences in receipts and payments.\n\n* **Investing Activities:**  Cash used in investing activities decreased from ($22,534) million in 2021 to ($15,783) million in 2022. This improvement is largely attributed to increased proceeds from short-term investment redemptions and a dividend received from a joint venture.  However, this was partially offset by significant cash outlays for acquisitions (Biohaven, Arena, and GBT).\n\n* **Financing Activities:** Cash used in financing activities increased from ($9,816) million in 2021 to ($14,834) million in 2022. This increase is mainly due to share repurchases, increased long-term debt repayments, and decreased proceeds from long-term debt issuance.\n\nIn summary, the table highlights significant changes in Pfizer's cash flow driven by factors related to its key products (Comirnaty and Paxlovid), strategic acquisitions, and financial decisions regarding investments and debt.", "The table describes the sources of funding for a company, categorized as internal and external.

Several adjustments, including depreciation, asset write-offs, and changes in working capital, impacted the net cash flow.\n\n* **Investing Activities:**  Net cash *used* in investing activities was substantial in all three years, primarily due to purchases of short-term investments and acquisitions.
